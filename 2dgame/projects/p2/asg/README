Project description: (Also, what image did you draw?) 
Draw a picture by using SDL 2.0. The painting covers different types of 
shapes and the implementation need to do in an object-oriented fashion.
What I try to draw is the Starry Night by Vincent van Gogh.


The easiest part of this project: 
To draw a simple shape, such as a circle and triangle. And filling is kind of
easy as well.

Problems that I had in completing this project:
For me, the most difficult shape is curve. Not only it is hard to code but also
it took me a lot of efforts to measure on the picture I chose. 

Another thing is the pattern I designed in this project. I wrote my main 
painting function in singleton way and the implement shapes by using 
polymorphism. It works fine since the functions of this project is not tough.
However, it is still paintaking to make all these classes work.

At last, I still have difficulty in overloading the operator of SDL_Point. I
once attempt to do it like this:

bool SDL_point::operator==(const SDL_Point &b){
  return x == b.x && y == b.y;
}
bool SDL_point::operator<(const SDL_Point &b){
  return (x < b.x) || (x == b.x && y < b.y);
}

However, these code can not survive the compiling. After doing some searching
on Internet, I 'overloaded' them by 'inline'.

I really want to draw my picture a bit better if time permits. While this great
painting has a lot of measures to cope with, I hardly had time to do so.
