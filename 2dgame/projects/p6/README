Project description:

This time, my game has conclusion and sound.

To win this game, a player need to destruct the enemies' home gate. In my game,
kill endless enemy won't acquire any reward. So just keep going to the very end
and slash their gate! On the other hand, Either player or our base is destroied
will bring this game to lose.

When it comes to the end, it is capable of restart by hitting 'R' key.

Player in my game can perform light attack, heavy attack with a wave, jump, roll
and defend. Besides, he will fall back if he is under attack. The enemy only 
knows marching and eliminating everything in his way. So if the player rolling
through or jump over him, the enemy will keep pushing to our home. Thus, it is
a smart way to attack them from behind!

The memory leak increased when integrating sound in program. While the number is
not more than the example you offered us. Thus I leave it away with hope that it
is due to the SDL.

As time is limited and I was sticked to variety of the motions, I hardly had time
to perform any of the pizzazz, which is such a pity for me.

The easiest part of this project:

Sound and looking for the sounds.

Problems that I had in completing this project:

Time! Time is the most difficult problem to deal with! Especially at such time of
the seamaster. Another thing is leaving. I enjoyed so much in this lecture and all
of sudden, it comes to the end. 
I really want to extend my gratitude for your careful instruction and kindness.
By the way, I got a joy offer to develop games! So many thanks to what you have
taught me!
