Project description: To get the input text and output it upside down and backwards by using flex

The easiest part of this project: To input ASCII code of each upside down character.

Problems that I had in completing this project: To come up with the function from a character to its upside down counterpart. Another thing is to read unicode directly from code.txt, but I still can't find a solution for this.
