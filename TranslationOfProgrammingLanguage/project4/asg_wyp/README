Project description: Implementing an AST to interpret the expressions by using polymorphism and overload of operators.

The easiest part of this project: Overloading operators and implementing nodes deriving from the base.

Problems that I had in completing this project: The most effort-taking part for me is to get the entire mypy syntax clear. I spent days in playing the ast.intFloat to figure out my own AST but failed in unary operates. It is time-consuming to eliminate all the memory leaks as well.
