Project no: 6

Project due date: December 13th, 2017

Project description: As the final project, this project requires mypy to perform
propagation of parameters, including actual parameters and formal parameters, so
that recursion can be implemented as well.

The easiest part of this project: Based on the structure implemented in previous
project, the easiest thing is to understand the mechanism of the parameter
passing.

Problems that I had in completing this project: The most difficult thing to deal
with is matching the formal parameters with actual ones. In this project, I try 
to figure out the way python cope with functions in different scope. The example
can be like this:
x = 5
def f():
  print x
  
def g():
  x = 10
  f()
  
g()

In class, we thought the result would be 10 while python gives 5. As I tried to solve
this promblem, I came up with a idea from Operating System. We can store current stack
and then clear it. For f() and g() are both defined in scope 0, when f() is called 
within g(), we just store what g() has done and then move all of g() out of the stack 
scope by scope. When we done with f(), we just restore the previous stck back and the
correct result occures.

Besides, mypy can receive several parameters and give correct answer, like:
def f(x, y):
	if x == y:
		return x**y
	else :
	    return x%-y
print f(7, 17)

Also, recursion example can be seen in my cases/recursion.py file and no memory leaks.

And I fixed all the problems in my project 5.

As this is the last project, I'd express my sincerely gratitude to all the skills you 
taught in class. I'm getting more comfortable with both c++ and Python, and really enjoy 
to play with them.

At last, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!
