Project description:
Design and implement an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent and interpret my Python code. The program ranslates Python parameters including actual parameters and formal parameters. Also, the program implements recursion such as factorial.

The parameters are retrieved as vector of Node* and stored as ParaNode. The argments are stored as ArgNode. In the CallNode, the parameters and arguments are compared to pass the arguments into functions. When return the function itself, the program implements recursions.

The test.py script processes all test cases in the cases folder, generating the .out files from python results and comparing them with MyPy results. All test cases in the cases folder passed the test.
