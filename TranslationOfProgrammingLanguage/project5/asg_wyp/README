Project no: 6

Project due date: December 13th, 2017

Project description: As the final project, this project requires mypy to perform
propagation of parameters, including actual parameters and formal parameters, so
that recursion can be implemented as well.

The easiest part of this project: Based on the structure implemented in previous
project, the easiest thing is to understand the mechanism of the parameter
passing.

Problems that I had in completing this project: The most difficult thing to deal
with is matching the formal parameters with actual ones. In this project, I set
up a new table to manage all the formals, which is called ParaTable. The eval()
of ParaNode is to matching the actuals and make the function running.

And I fixed all the problems in my project 5.

As this is the last project, I'd express my sincerely gratitude to all the skills you taught in class.
I'm getting more comfortable with both c++ and Python, and really enjoy to play
with them.

At last, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!
